# Changes Summary: AI Removal and Back Button Implementation

## Changes Made:

### 1. Removed AI Functionality
- ✅ Emptied `/components/AIEnhancedReportForm.tsx` (kept file to avoid import errors)
- ✅ Updated `/components/Dashboard.tsx` to remove AI-enhanced report form and AI references
- ✅ Removed AI-related API methods from `/utils/api.tsx` (detectCategory, searchDepartments)
- ✅ App.tsx already using `AdminDashboard` instead of `EnhancedAdminDashboard`

### 2. Added Back Buttons
- ✅ `/components/FieldWorkerDashboard.tsx` - Added back button to navigate to admin-login
- ✅ `/components/DepartmentHeadDashboard.tsx` - Added back button to navigate to admin-login
- ✅ `/components/HistoryPage.tsx` - Already has back button
- ✅ `/components/MapPage.tsx` - Already has back button
- ✅ `/components/EnhancedProfilePage.tsx` - Already has back button
- ✅ `/components/AdminComplaints.tsx` - Already has back button
- ✅ `/components/AdminDepartments.tsx` - Already has back button
- ✅ Other admin components use `AdminSidebar` which provides navigation to dashboard

### 3. Preserved Working DM Dashboard
- ✅ App.tsx uses `AdminDashboard` component (the previous working version)
- ✅ All admin functionality remains intact
- ✅ Role-based access control maintained
- ✅ Full complaint management system operational

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All AI functionality has been removed and back buttons have been added everywhere as requested. The DM dashboard and all admin functionality remains fully operational using the previous working AdminDashboard component.
